      <strong>Mobile Panini </strong> is the culmination of the dream of
      Antonio and Carmen Dolcini, who came to America looking to serve people
      the authentic recipes learned from their Sicilian family.
    </p>

    <p>
      Antonio began work as a child in his grandmother's deli where he learned
      the age-old secrets of Sicilian cooking. He refined his technique at the
      Culinary Institute of Milan. His younger brother, Carmen, with no less
      of a love for cooking and good food, also worked in the deli and became
      well-acquainted with the open-air fresh food markets of his home town.
      Carmen too, is a proud graduate of the Culinary Institute of Milan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now you can enjoy what they have learned and mastered, right outside
      your door; but with no compromises in freshness or delicacy of
      preparation. We've partnered with <em> Curbside Thai </em>to bring you
      the finest cuisine on four wheels - from the East and the West!
